subtitle:
category: The Flesh Is Weak
1. Prosthetic [replacement] Cat's Claws. | Abv in Q-Nano Wire or Beam-Sword variants
2. Thought to speech translator. | Rapidly discontinued. Cats are indeed assholes and dogs are indeed stupid.
3. Chronal Dilator | Your pet will live twice as long!  ...and move at half speed.
4. Synthetic alloy-reinforced stomach | Your pet will be able to feed on all the trash left around in the city! Waste no more on pet food! Disclaimer: your pet's farts may experience changes, it is recommended to use a gas mask (not included on price) 
5. Built-In Leash. | In a fleshy sac on your pet's neck, an extendable fuzzy leash keeps your pet close, but not completely out of harm's way.
6. Always in our ❤️. | An holographic 3d projector inserted in the pet's neck, playing in an endless loop, the faces of the owner's previous animals (or whatever they program into it) resized and remapped over the pet's head 
7. Fecal surprise. | Thanks to internal modifications the power unit inside the animal allows it to drop a turd like a real animal once per day.
Coming into contact with it burns like acid for D4 damage. (If pet is a monkey, monkey is immune and can throw it.)
8. Musculad. | Syntheflesh © small fully jointed human arms, capable of holding small/medium items and punching (d4 damage).
9. Everfeed. | Circular digestive system where fecal matter is reprocessed and enriched into a nutritional paste. Add water and Everfeed Purification tablets once a month. 
10. Internal Remote. | Now your pet can watch TV while you’re away! Warning: Cats may use Internal Remote to hack the Net.
