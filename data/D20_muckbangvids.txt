19. Dr Kodie Drinks the Tank | Dr Kodie used to be a pretty popular streamer back in the day, it's a damn shame what happened to her.

Unfortunately the views didn't last. Kodie started doing Muk Bang videos on the side here and there. The videos did really well but also brought in a much less wholesome crowd. Before long the educational kids videos had stopped entirely as the Muk Bang fans only grew rowdier. Her subscriber base continued to fall only to be replaced with the most detestable adamant creatures imaginable. With little money left for a new video and hordes of fans harassing her she made one last video :Dr Kodie Drinks the Tank. In the video she drains the 400 gal tank and then fries up all her fishy friends up into teppanyaki. and eats one by one, tears streaming down her face. They say after that a petition led by fans of her former educational content got her channel taken down.

In a flash of inspiration, his channel pivoted on a dime from spelunking to muckbang. His first and last video is him consuming the entire stockpile in one sitting. The video concludes with ------- extreme distension ------ rupture ----- trying to cram ------- back into his open gut ------- five days worth of silence before --------- discovered by local canines.
