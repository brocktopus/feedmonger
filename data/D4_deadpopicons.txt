1. Mx. Ego Death 667. They were a huge Acid-Panda-Gaze-Pop star. They died in the collapse of the building FF3EB5 on Skymall Street as the tunnels beneath for extracting ressources got too unstable.
2. BOJO, star of numerous unboxing/unwrapping vid-sims. Last seen on camera in G0 unwrapping their own skin after being infected by a swarm of burrowing nanopedes.
3. Glory Glory Glory, post-ironic deistic revivalist. Their biggest hit, 'God Is More Online Than You', is still in the clubs nearly two weeks after their bodily transcendence at the whirling shovels of a malfunctioning street cleaner- an almost unprecedented cultural endurance.
4. First of the AIDJs, Entity: Wolfgang, later renamed itself to Killex after hitting breakout sapience. After it published 'I WILL PEEL THE WET MEAT OFF YOUR BONES' and 'SILICON>CARBON', a pvnk crew were hired to throw its harddrive into moving traffic for fifty credits and coupons for half off on waffle cones.
