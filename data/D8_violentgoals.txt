1. Beat someone to death with 2 freshly ripped off heads
2. Steal a car. Strap explosives to it. Launch it over a ramp at corpos and/or secops. Bonus points if you jump out and start blasting mid air.
3. make a a literal shitsplosion apocalypse in the Cy sewers system that would fill up from the poor places of Cy to the richest places around Cy along with the corpos, secops, punks, etc.
4. Marc Donald's mukbang (cannibalize the dead CEO's rotting remains, not eat at the restaurant).
5. Invent and distribute Hat Trick gun to the populace and watch the citizens freak themselves to death, out of every exit. Apparently the schematics are inside this interesting metal puzzle box. Just gimmie a minute, I can get it open, its just stubborn, gotta flip it, then ...
6. Multipart goal coarse: fire two guns whilst jumping through the air; fire while in a high speed pursuit; and shoot your gun up in the air whilst screaming "Aaaaargh!"
7. Land a 360-no-scope triple kill irl (celebrated by teabagging the victims of course, all on stream)
8. Master the Knife-Game-Song, and become thee expert of Five-Finger-Fillet.
