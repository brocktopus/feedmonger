1. Shatner Fu | your fighting style is like a 60s scifi stuntman. | ~double axe handle forearm strike 1d8dmg | ~Add a Glitch if your shirt is torn
2. Improv Fu | your fighting style is using random items and  scenery if you have no weapons. | -add a glitch(or omen)  for being creative with the scenery attacks or checks | 
-As for damage small items ( like coffee mugs or chairs) is like d4-d6 | For big items (like ladders or even your body.) is a d12- d20 | -For defense or checks is your toughness instead of strength and agility 
3. Tie kwon dough is a Corpo martial art unique unto itself. The word can be translated to mean "I don't speak Korean you fucking racist". The particulars of this combat sport involve picking up one's phone, and calling for security with lightning fast reflexes! Only Corpos can learn Tie kwon dough. A Corpo who knows Tie kwon dough may not act in combat except to flee or call in reinforcements. Beginning on combat round 2, reinforcements start arriving. Corpo Reinforcement Operatives | HP 6 | Morale 7 | Undercover vest -d4  Marksman rifle d10 | Fall Back: Even though they work for some horrible monsters, these people all have lives and families. These enemies also roll morale checks if any of their fellow ops are down, not just the leader. If one operative fails their morale check, they all fail. When they fail, roll d4 (instead of d6) on the Flee/ Surrender table.
4. Baristasu | Mainly practiced within the great coffee conglomerates, this highly technical martial art involves a variety of performance and self defense forms for the brewing of hot liquid related products and weapons. However recently one of the great conglomerates folded leaving many barista's without a foodal lord. This has lead to the rise of street Baronin serving hot bitter pain with a side of pastry. | Quick pour: The very basis of Baristasu, the quick pour distracts the opponent with a flashy trick opening them up to attack.  dr12, your next attack on the targeted opponent does full weapon damage. | Pain au curatif: An expertly crafted multilayer bread stuffed with a unique healing compound known only to Baristasu masters. D6 hp.
5. Interpretive dance-Fu | You have listened to the beats so much you learn to time the attacks well enough to the metronome. Are you on the rhythm?: from each turn to change these beats per minute or BPM roll a d20 which gives you an attack for how many times per bpm. | 1-5 40-49 bpm- 1 attack  | 6-10 50-79bpm -2 attacks | 11-13 80-100 bpm- 3 attacks | 14-16 109-130bpm - 4 attacks | 17-18  130-170 bpm - 5 attacks | 19-20 171-200 bpm - 6 attacks | Roll the number of attacks you do.  for instance  5 attacks for a revolver d6 5d6 and roll 5d20 to check.
