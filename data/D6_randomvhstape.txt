1. WM3: Macho vs Steamboat, but the 90k audience in the attendance are hooded figures, with red eyes, making rattlesnake noises
2. Cyborgian Gladiators, A low-budget gameshow where humans face off in challenges of might against early gen AI bots. Dismemberment and physical trauma are frequent, the audience cheers are as well.
3. Quantum sit-com, Your favourite episode of your favourite sit-com starts to play. However, it slowly degenerates into the cast murdering each other in cold blood. The last person standing points at you, says your name and runs at the camera. Snow Crash...
4. Multiple hours of industrial machines that grind bones of long pigs. Labelled "Morloch ASMR part 6: Knochenfr√§se"
5. Leaked failed experimental advertisement video from Kaytell. Flashing lights and buzzing sound directly affect impulse control centres of brain, making the affected person unable to break the eye contact and leave to the point of dying of starvation unless the tv is turned off
6. Hand-recorder footage of a wild rave, which continues through SecOps arriving and gunning down everyone present. A cartoon mascot pops up at the end to remind all you kiddies that noise complaints are serious business, so keep it down!
