The roundabout doors of the main entrance open up to the 3rd level of a grand 5 story atrium. Artwork from days long past decorate glass elevators and escalators, bringing back memories of a world forgotten. Each level is filled with identical geometric shelves that once contained expertly categorized information, separated by floor. They are practically empty now, but precious scraps of lost texts can still be recovered with enough patience. Librarians here are meek and have become terrified of any and all visitors, regardless of intention. This place is the 3rd QUIETEST place in all of CY."
