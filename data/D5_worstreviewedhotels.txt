1. Rightobear Arms Coffin-Hotel | The Rightobear arms is among the finest in fully automatic coffin hotels here in Cy, equipped with the latest in 19X4 technology! Out EverNew systems ensure the hotel will stay brand new, just like the day it was built. Visit our scenic 49 floor tower located in North Burnchurch Hex, just between the Industrial zone, Laketon, and Galgbacken. | 👨‍🔧   Got locked in capsule for 16 hours.   Brickford Wahl     ❤️ 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤 | A gang of local thugs, who have taken over the entire lobby, mugged me, then locked me inside one of the broken capsules for around 16 hours! My phone and everything was stolen so I didn't know what else to do but yell for help. Eventually someone heard me screaming and let me out. I swear those cameras aren't even hooked up to anything, and the least they could do is buy a security droid or something, shit the prices here are high enough. I ended up getting fired from 3rd job for not showing up for my shift. | 👷‍♀️  This place is falling apart!   Holly Graham     ❤️ 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤 | I was climbing the rusty ass metal stairs to the 31st floor (because or course the elevator in this giant tower doesn't work) when about a 3m section of stairs collapsed right in front of my face! I nearly died! Please avoid this jagged rusty deathtrap at all costs!  0 out of 5 hearts! 
2. Chasm Towers International Hotel | Come to the pinnacle of luxury, Chasm Towers. Founded by a strange robed man striking a possum with a stick, Chasm Towers gives every room a balcony view of the former historic Chelsie Hotel, which rest inside a 300meter pit of flame.  Free Continental Breakfast, no pets, no kids, no foreigners, none of that | Im locked in the bathroom of my room! Something is trying to break down the door! HELP! ❤️ 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤  | First off; its not a tower, its a single story motel. Second; the balcony view is a broken sliding glass door that is 8 inches away from the edge of the chasm, no railing. Last; the old Chelsie Hotel at the bottom of the chasm doesnt look like its burning. Sure, its on fire, but its not turning black or falling apart. It just keeps burning. ❤️ 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖕  | Former Anonymus Employee here. DO NOT GO HERE. I quit 6 weeks ago and somehow cannot make it out of the hotel. Anytime I get near the lobby door, I pass out and wake up in room 7:7. Come to think of it, a blood sample was required for my application. Maybe if I drink someone elses blood, I can fool the hotel. :thumbsup:
3. Hen2Pan Boutique Apartments by Mr Harry Park-Retts | Hen2Pan prouds itself on its long tradition of utmost commitment to ensuring the most pleasurable stay for its guests. Located conveniently just a walking  distance from the Remembrance Plaza, you are sure to attend all your matters with certainty that there is a place for you to come back to relax and forget about the whole world while all your other needs are taken care of. Call this number to inquire | ❤️🖤🖤🖤🖤  Do NOT go there. The entire premise is just an undercover cult. The receptionist asked a lot of weird questions, and all baggage porters didn't even pay any attention to us. We accidentally found some strange circles with some writings in them under the furniture while unpacking. In the middle of the night, we were awoken by screaming form the next room. We tried to leave immediately, but were only let go after threatening to notify the corporate authority. Three days afterwards we all started to develop delirium with strange symptoms and required hospitalisation under suspicion of poisoning. The whole place should be burned to the ground. | 🖤🖤🖤🖤❤️ Very strange place, pretty bad. Room service v bad. Alleged taking care of all needs really just weird guided meditation, boring. Water in the tap so bad it looked red, then like water then red again. Got a terrible headache, had to leave. Do not recommend
4. The Antheia garden hotel by owner RONALD SOLARISTAR | Antheia garden hotel is an ecological hotel and friendly based on our guidelines along with using our sate of the art chemical for making the plants grow and never kills them. make this a perfect place to relax and enjoy the gardening experience. All our food is grown here and it’s plant based. | So :sync: to book one now! | Here’s our reviews: | 🖤🖤🖤🖤♥️ TO ANYONE LOOKING AT THIS REVIEW DONT GO IN THERE! THERES PEOPLE TURNING INTO THOSE PLANT THINGS!  THE PLACE IS OVERRUN WITH SO MUCH VEGETATION! IM GETTING OUT OF HERE! -xXMaXXXineXx1993 | 🖤🖤🖤🖤♥️ DON’T eat the “plant based” foods as advertised. They contain something that makes people turning into those things. - Johnny_gitarxx38 | 🖤🖤🖤🖤♥️  anonymous employee here, I went to the basement of the hotel that has that chemical compound and it is a horror show down there. You don’t want to go there or be as plant food. STAY OUT OF THE BASEMENT! YOU HEAR ME! - A-N_Stein3404
5. Dunharrow Air B&B&B&B&BBQ [Bed, Breakfast, BORG, Bloodshed, and Barbeque] | This quiet fishing cottage, set in the fjords of REDACTED has been refurbished to accommodate 4 overnight guests. The attic is made from 200 year old oak timbers, while the basement features a 30'x30' octagonal gladiatorial area. Losers are served at our Sunday BBQs | ❤️ 🖤 🖤 🖤 :blood:  They dragged my husband into the basement last night. But my coffee and quiche arrived promptly the next morning. I found his wedding ring inside | ❤️ 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤  The cottage was nice, but the 300 meter zigzagged stone stairs leading up the fjord was a bit inconvenient for carrying our bags. Manager says there is a card game in the basement tonight, but sounds a bit shady | ❤️ 🖤 🖤 🖤 :yeah:  GROSHNAR SHALL BE VICTORIOUS THIS EVE! TREMBLE AT MY MIGHT! [i ordered room service two hours ago, nothing]
