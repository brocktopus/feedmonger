2. The BURGER BLAST Secret recipe | A rare burger that has been discontinued even though it was popular. unfortunately, he has this also password protected. Also most of the corpos are out to get you.
3. Neo-Meta-PanChrysopoeia v. 1.0 (Alpha) | a wondrous program capable of transmutation of any data it comes in contact with into currently highly priced cryptocurrency. Even more unfortunately, once unleashed, it spreads wirelessly, corrupting anything that contains any sort of programming into unusable brick, with only the cursed tokens having replaced everything down to OS. Pretty much everybody either wants it for themselves or permanently gone, the latter for good reasons.
4. camera_20W2-04-00-012692 | Live footage of the Incident from an on-scene witness, rigorously scrubbed clean of the NANOs until it's actually legible. Watch it and you will learn exactly what CY is.
5. BANG.exe | A digital gun. Run it on anything- from a zero-bit doorbell to a supercomputer -and it deals d8, ignoring armor but -d3 if the target is protected by a firewall or similar. Utterly undetectable. Targets killed by it show no physical or neurological damage. On a fumble, for the next d6 turns, you cannot choose who is targeted when you run BANG.exe.
6. Whiterabbit.exe | your consciousness is transported into a digital labyrinth, akin to Tron. The dead industrialist is there waiting for you. He smiles and whispers: "Run"
