category: Someone Else's Trash
1. A STALKER, which expected to be delivered to the penthouse of the richest contact of the PCs. Will attempt to terminate any obstacle as it continues on foot.
2. A real baby Capybara. 100% natural.
3. A nano-infested person ensnared in cables and wires. A living data-storage device. May have 3d4 * 1000 creds on them. May explode.
4. A pipe bomb meant for a high-up, everyone near takes 2d4 damage (roll for defense)
5. At least 200 gallons of an unknown fluid locked in unusual metal barrels. It’s currently leaking, and it smells like death.
6. A hermetically sealed box with lead-lined walls containing a single severed finger.
7. A bunch of corpses in a circular configuration around a small stone obelisk. It is black as the night, and somehow, it’s speaking.
8. A couple of pvnks have already looted the container. All that’s left is graffiti, markings left behind revealing that a small gang did this.
9. A perfectly preserved ancient wooden racing chariot and two fully charged mechanical horses.
10. A hot, fresh pizza. Real dairy cheeses, highest quali synthHAM™️, artisanal crust, and real  pineapple. It looks just like the ones in historical dramas.
11. A brand-new latest generation BetterBride™️ android. The Ultimate Indulgence version. Not a stock one either, someone must've dropped a shitload of creds in the customizer.
12. 1d6 high-powered, top of the line androids with integrated mantis blades and submachine guns. All of them have been activated, and all of them are extremely hostile.
