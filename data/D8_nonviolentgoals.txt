3. Your nano cucumber pickle is finally edible.
4. Find and pet 3d4 cats
5. Do at least 1 live performance of some sort
6. Locate that friend you parted ways with after a fight, to tell them you're sorry about it, you were hurt inside and didn't know. But you grew.
7. See the sunset in all its glory. Uncluttered by the ads and HUD in your RCD just once.
8. Watching the last moment of the MMORKG shutting down its servers. Saying goodbye to the chat, the players and all of your friends you met and thanking for these moments & memories of having fun in the MMORKG.
